# Mental Health Progress Tracker React App
A web application designed to provide mental health support and resources.

*Project Overview*

The Mental Health Progress Tracker is a web application that helps users log their daily mental health statuses, track their progress over time, and view trends. It allows users to log key aspects of their mental health, such as mood ratings, anxiety levels, and physical activity. The application provides visualizations of trends and real-time updates to enhance the user experience.
